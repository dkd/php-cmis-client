PHP CMIS Client is a port of OpenCMIS (Java) to PHP.
Interfaces are mostly the same so most OpenCMIS examples should
be also usable for this PHP CMIS Library.

Some basic examples can be found in the example folder
(code is not nice but shows how it works).

The functionality is largely complete, we are happy about PRs if you require something not implemented yet.

Server Requirements
------------------------------
Currently only the **Browser binding** is implemented. This means you need **Alfresco 4.2** or higher or some other CMIS server supporting the Browser binding.
We are open about merging additional bindings but are not developing them at the moment.

External Usage
------------------------------
As far as we know the major dependants of this library are the CMIS extensions for [TYPO3 CMS](https://github.com/dkd/typo3-ext-cmis-service) and [Drupal 8](https://www.drupal.org/project/cmis).
